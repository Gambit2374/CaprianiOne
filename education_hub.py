        **What are Candlesticks?** Candlesticks visually represent price movements over time, with:
        - **Body**: Shows open and close prices (green = price up, red = price down).
        - **Wicks (Shadows)**: Indicate high and low prices during the period.
        **Common Patterns:**
        - **Doji**: Open = close, signals indecision and potential reversal (e.g., small body, long wicks).
        - **Hammer**: Bullish reversal after a downtrend (small body, long lower wick, little or no upper wick).
        - **Shooting Star**: Bearish reversal after an uptrend (small body, long upper wick, little or no lower wick).
        - **Engulfing Patterns**: Bullish (green body engulfs prior red body) or bearish (red body engulfs prior green body) signals strong reversals.
        **Guidance:** Use Stock Analysis charts to identify patterns; combine with RSI, MACD, or volume for confirmation.

        - **Use:** Crossovers signal potential trend changes (e.g., EMA20 crossing SMA200).

        **Q: How do I interpret signals in Stock Analysis or Top 25 Stocks?**
        - A: Strong Buy = enter long, Strong Sell = enter short, Buy/Sell = consider with caution, Hold = wait for clearer signals. Combine with charts and indicators.

        **Q: What does â€˜N/Aâ€™ mean in data?**
        - A: It means Yahoo Finance couldnâ€™t fetch data. Try another ticker or check later; some stocks may not support all metrics.

        **Q: How do I use RSI, Bollinger Bands, and MACD effectively?**
        - A: RSI >70 or <30 signals overbought/oversold; Bollinger Bands show volatility (wide = high, narrow = low); MACD crossovers indicate momentum shifts. See our tabsâ€™ guidance.

        **Q: Is trading risky, and how can I mitigate it?**
        - A: Yes, trading carries risk, but our tools and risk management tips (e.g., diversification, stop-losses) help. Start small, verify data, and learn continuously.

        **Q: How do I identify candlestick patterns?**
        - A: Look for Doji (indecision), Hammer/Shooting Star (reversals), or Engulfing patterns (strong moves). Use our charts and illustrations, combining with indicators.
